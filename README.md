CobblemonTrainerGenerator made for [CobblemonTrainer](https://github.com/davo899/CobblemonTrainers) by selfdot

GUI provided by the mod itself isn't bad, but it feels quite cumbersome when adding Pokemon and configuring their movesets. This script aims to mitigate that by automating moveset creation.

## Usage

3. Run main.exe
